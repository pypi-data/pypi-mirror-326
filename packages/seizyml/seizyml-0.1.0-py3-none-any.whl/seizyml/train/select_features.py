def select_features(x, y_true, feature_labels, r_threshold, feature_size, nleast_correlated=0):
    """
     Selects features based on ANOVA F-values, while dropping highly correlated features 
     according to their ANOVA ranks, and optionally includes the least correlated features.
    
     Parameters:
     - x (array-like): The feature matrix with shape (n_samples, n_features).
     - y_true (array-like): The true class labels with shape (n_samples,).
     - feature_labels (array-like): The feature labels corresponding to columns from x.
     - r_threshold (float): Correlation threshold for feature selection. Features with correlation 
       higher than this threshold will be considered for dropping.
     - feature_size (list of int): List of sizes for the feature subsets to be selected.
     - nleast_correlated (int): Number of least correlated features to be included 
       in the final selection.
    
     Returns:
     - feature_dict (dict): A dictionary with keys corresponding to the different feature subsets.
       Each key has two variations:
         - 'best_{size}': Top features based solely on ANOVA ranks.
         - 'best_{size}_and_leastcorr': Top features combined with the least correlated features.
