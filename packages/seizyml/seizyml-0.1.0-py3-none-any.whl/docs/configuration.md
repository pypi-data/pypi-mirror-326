## Configuration settings

All settings can be edited from the `config.yaml` file.
-> The `config.yaml` is created when the path is first set in **SeizyML** set from [temp_config.yaml](../seizyml/temp_config.yaml).

**1) Basic data parameters**
- channels : List containing the names of LFP/EEG channels, e.g. ["hippocampus", "frontal cortex"].
- win : Window size for processing and predictions in seconds, **default and recommended is 5 seconds**.
- gui_win: Window size for verification, **default and recommended is 1 second**.
- fs : Sampling rate of .h5 files, **default and recommended is 100 Hz**.

**2) Paths**

*Created by user:*
- train_path: Path to training directory, e.g. "C:\\Users\\...\\train_directory".
- parent_path : Path to parent directory, e.g. "C:\\Users\\...\\parent_directory".
- data_dir : Child directory name where .h5 files are present, default is **"data"**.
  
*Created by App:*
- processed_dir : Child directory name with h5 preprocessed data, default is **"processed"**.
- model_predictions_dir : Child directory name with model predictions are present (.csv), default is **"model_predictions"**.
- verified_predictions_dir : Child directory name where user verified predictions are present (.csv), default is **"verified_predictions"**.
- trained_model_dir : Child directory from train_path where trained models are stored, default is **"models"**.

**3) Feature selection parameters**
- features : List containing features to be used for feature selection.
- feature_select_thresh : Threshold for removing highlly correlated features, defulat is 0.9.
- feature_size : List containing size of feature sets, default is [5,10,15].
- nleast_corr : Number of list correlated features to include.

**4) Post processing methods**
- post_processing_method : Type of post processing method. Options are `dual_threshold` (default), `dilation_erosion`, and `erosion_dilation`.
- rolling_window : Window size for smoothing predictions in `dual_threshold`. Default is 6. Higher number increases stringency.
- event_threshold : Probability threshold for event detection in `dual_threshold`. Default is .5. Higher number increases stringency.
- boundary_threshold : Probability threshold for boundary detection detection in `dual_threshold`. Default is .2. Higher number increases stringency. Has to be lower than event threshold.
- dilation : Size of dilation structuring element in `dilation_erosion`, and `erosion_dilation` methods. Default is 2. Higher number reduces stringency.
- erosion : Size of erosion structuring element in `dilation_erosion`, and `erosion_dilation` methods. Default is 2. Higher number increases stringency.

**5) Variables updated internally during app execution**
- file_check : True, if .h5 in data folder have the right structure.
- processed_check : True, if .h5 files were cleaned.
- predicted_check : True, if model predictions were generated.
- model_id : Name of model chosen during model training.
