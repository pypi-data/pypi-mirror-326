## File Editor

The file editor skill allows an agent to view, create, edit, insert, and undo edits to files. It is based on the [original implementation](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/tools/edit.py) by Anthropic (licensed under MIT). The `file_editor` function in package `freeact_skills.editor` is intended for internal use only.
