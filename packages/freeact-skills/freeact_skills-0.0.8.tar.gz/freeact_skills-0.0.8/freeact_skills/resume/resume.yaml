  description: 'krasserm/akka-stream-eventsourcing. This project brings to Akka Streams
    what Akka Persistence brings to Akka Actors: persistence via event sourcing. In
    the same way as persistent actors in Akka Persistence, stateful *request processors*
    in akka-stream-eventsourcing form a consistency boundary around internal state
    but additionally provide type safety and end-to-end back-pressure for the whole
    event sourcing message flow.'

  description: 'krasserm/grails-jaxrs. grails-jaxrs is a Grails plugin that supports
    the development of RESTful web services based on the Java API for RESTful Web
    Services (JSR 311: JAX-RS). It is targeted at developers who want to structure
    the web service layer of an application in a JSR 311 compatible way but still
    want to continue to use Grails'' powerful features such as GORM, automated XML
    and JSON marshalling, Grails services, Grails filters and so on. This plugin is
    an alternative to Grails'' built-in mechanism for implementing RESTful web services.'
