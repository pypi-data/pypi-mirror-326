Our Copyright Policy
--------------------
Nucleic uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Nucleic
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Nucleic
Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the Nucleic repositories.
With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:

matplotlib
------------------
John Hunter began Matplotlib around 2003. Since shortly before his passing in 2012, Michael Droettboom has been the lead maintainer of Matplotlib, but, as has always been the case, Matplotlib is the work of many.

Prior to July of 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, the copyright of the source code was held by John Hunter. As of July 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, matplotlib has moved to a shared copyright model.

Matplotlib uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Matplotlib. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Matplotlib source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Matplotlib Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the matplotlib repositories.

The Matplotlib Development Team is the set of all contributors to the matplotlib project. A full list can be obtained from the git version control logs.
