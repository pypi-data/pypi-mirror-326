# prettyfmt

`prettyfmt` is a tiny library to make your outputs, logs, and
`__str__()` representations slightly more beautiful.

It offers simple but general functions for formatting and abbreviating
objects and dataclasses, dicts, words and phrases, filenames, titles, long
strings, timestamps, ages, and sizes.

Only deps are `humanize`, `humanfriendly`, and `strif`.
