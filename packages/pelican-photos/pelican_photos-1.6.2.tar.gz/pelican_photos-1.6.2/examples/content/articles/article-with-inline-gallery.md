Title: Article with inline Gallery
Date: 2022-01-04
Category: Gallery
Summary: This is an example with an inline gallery.

**If you don't see a gallery here, you have to enable inline galleries**

## Old pattern

This uses the old and deprecated gallery pattern.

We have to add spaces so the photos plugin won't replace our code example with a gallery.
To use it replace "g a l l e r y" with "gallery" or use the new pattern format.

```
g a l l e r y::{photo}example_gallery
```

gallery::{photo}example_gallery

## New pattern

Better use the new one introduced in photos 1.1.0

```
<div gallery="{photo}example_gallery"></div>
```

<div gallery="{photo}example_gallery"></div>
