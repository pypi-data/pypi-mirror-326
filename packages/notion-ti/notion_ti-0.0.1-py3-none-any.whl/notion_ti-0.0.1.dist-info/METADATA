    Hello and welcome!  To make use of this API collection collection as it&#39;s written, please duplicate [this database template](https://www.notion.so/8e2c2b769e1d47d287b9ed3035d607ae?v&#x3D;dc1b92875fb94f10834ba8d36549bd2a).  ﻿Under the &#x60;Variables&#x60; tab, add your environment variables to start making requests. You will need to [create an integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) to retrieve an API token. You will also need additional values, such as a database ID and page ID, which can be found in your Notion workspace or from the database template mentioned above.  For our full documentation, including sample integrations and guides, visit [developers.notion.com](https://developers.notion.com/)﻿.  Please note: Pages that are parented by a database _must_ have the same properties as the parent database. If you are not using the database template provided, the request &#x60;body&#x60; for the page endpoints included in this collection should be updated to match the properties in the parent database being used. See documentation for [Creating a page](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-page) for more information.  To learn more about creating an access token, see our [official documentation](https://developers.notion.com/reference/create-a-token) and read our [Authorization](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#step-3-send-the-code-in-a-post-request-to-the-notion-api) guide.
