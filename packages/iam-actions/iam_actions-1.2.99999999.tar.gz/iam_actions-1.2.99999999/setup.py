IT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED.\n\n# iam_actions\n\n`iam_actions` is a python module which contains a dictionary of AWS IAM information. Ideally, it is a complete catalog of all AWS services, actions, and resource types. The information is scraped from the AWS documentation pages.\n\nNightly, the scraping service runs, and publishes a new version with the date appended. \n\nThe package is meant to be used as a consumable package, but it also contains the code to generate the definitions for packaging.\n\nThere are three "roots" that you can consume: actions, resource_types, and services. They all currently return as dict\'s. *However, in a future release, it will be returned as python data structures*\n\n## Actions\n\nActions is a listing of all the actions for a given service. The structure is as follows:\n```\n{\n    "service_name": {\n        "action_name: {\n            "access_level": access_level,\n            "action": action_name,\n            "condition_keys": [condition_key1, ...],\n            "description": description\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTherefore, you can find information about an action as follows\n\n```\n>>> iam_actions.actions[\'s3\'][\'GetObject\']\n{\'access_level\': \'Read\', \'action\': \'GetObject\', \'condition_keys\': [\'s3:AccessPointNetworkOrigin\', \'s3:DataAccessPointAccount\', \'s3:DataAccessPointArn\', \'s3:ExistingObjectTag/<key>\', \'s3:ResourceAccount\', \'s3:TlsVersion\', \'s3:authType\', \'s3:signatureAge\', \'s3:signatureversion\', \'s3:x-amz-content-sha256\'], \'description\': \'Grants permission to retrieve objects from Amazon S3\', \'orphan\': False, \'resources\': [\'object\']}\n```\n\n## Services\n\nServices list information about the service. The structure is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    "service_name": {\n        "Actions": [action1, ...]\n        "ServiceNames": [service_name1, ...]\n        "ARNFormats": [arn_format1, ...]\n        "ConditionKeys": [condition_key1, ...]\n        "HasResource": bool\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Resource Types\n\nResource Types list information about the resource types for the service. The structure is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    "service_name": {\n        "resource_name": {\n            "arn_pattern": arn_pattern,\n            "condition_keys": [condition_key1, ...]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\nimport iam_actions\n\nprint(item_actions.services)\nprint(item_actions.actions)\nprint(item_actions.resource_types)\n```\n',
