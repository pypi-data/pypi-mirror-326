# deloop
_a command-line delooper_

## Presentation

`deloop` is a command-line tool that takes two .wav files with _strictly_ identical parameters (sampling rate, number of frames), and returns a .wav file by substracting the two signals.

The targetted usecase is to separate stems from loops generated by a looper. For instance :

* loop 1: contains a drum loop
* loop 2: contains the same drum loop and a bass line

`deloop` allows to get the dry bass line back by removing the drums from the second loop (but we need the first loop to do that, of course...).

ðŸš¨ Attention: the performances will be altered if the drum loop has been modified in the overdub process...

## Usage

Intended to be used as a command-line tool:

```bash
$> deloop /path/to/file_a.wav /path/to/file_b.wav -o /path/to/output_file.wav
```
