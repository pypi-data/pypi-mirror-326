## Introduction

Testing is a crucial part of the development process, and it is essential to ensure that your cropio is performing as expected. With cropioAI, you can easily test your cropio and evaluate its performance using the built-in testing capabilities.

### Using the Testing Feature

We added the CLI command `cropioai test` to make it easy to test your cropio. This command will run your cropio for a specified number of iterations and provide detailed performance metrics. The parameters are `n_iterations` and `model`, which are optional and default to 2 and `gpt-4o-mini` respectively. For now, the only provider available is OpenAI.

```bash
cropioai test
```

If you want to run more iterations or use a different model, you can specify the parameters like this:

```bash
cropioai test --n_iterations 5 --model gpt-4o
```

or using the short forms:

```bash
cropioai test -n 5 -m gpt-4o
```

When you run the `cropioai test` command, the cropio will be executed for the specified number of iterations, and the performance metrics will be displayed at the end of the run.

A table of scores at the end will show the performance of the cropio in terms of the following metrics:

<center>**Tasks Scores (1-10 Higher is better)**</center>

| Tasks/Cropio/Agents  | Run 1 | Run 2 | Avg. Total | Agents                         | Additional Info                  |
|:------------------|:-----:|:-----:|:----------:|:------------------------------:|:---------------------------------|
| Task 1        |  9.0  |  9.5  |    **9.2**     | Professional Insights          |                                  |
|                    |       |       |            | Researcher                     |                                  |
| Task 2        |  9.0  | 10.0  |    **9.5**     | Company Profile Investigator   |                                  |
| Task 3        |  9.0  |  9.0  |    **9.0**     | Automation Insights            |                                  |
|                    |       |       |            | Specialist                     |                                  |
| Task 4        |  9.0  |  9.0  |    **9.0**     | Final Report Compiler          | Automation Insights Specialist   |
| Cropio         | 9.00  | 9.38  |    **9.2**     |                                |                                  |
| Execution Time (s) |  126  |  145  |    **135**     |                                |                                  |

The example above shows the test results for two runs of the cropio with two tasks, with the average total score for each task and the cropio as a whole.
