## Introduction

The training feature in CropioAI allows you to train your AI agents using the command-line interface (CLI). 
By running the command `cropioai train -n <n_iterations>`, you can specify the number of iterations for the training process.

During training, CropioAI utilizes techniques to optimize the performance of your agents along with human feedback. 
This helps the agents improve their understanding, decision-making, and problem-solving abilities.

### Training Your Cropio Using the CLI

To use the training feature, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your CropioAI project is located.
3. Run the following command:

```shell
cropioai train -n <n_iterations> <filename> (optional)
```
<Tip>
  Replace `<n_iterations>` with the desired number of training iterations and `<filename>` with the appropriate filename ending with `.pkl`.
</Tip>

### Training Your Cropio Programmatically

To train your cropio programmatically, use the following steps:

1. Define the number of iterations for training.
2. Specify the input parameters for the training process.
3. Execute the training command within a try-except block to handle potential errors.

```python Code
n_iterations = 2
inputs = {"topic": "CropioAI Training"}
filename = "your_model.pkl"

try:
    YourCropioName_Cropio().cropio().train(
      n_iterations=n_iterations, 
      inputs=inputs, 
      filename=filename
    )

except Exception as e:
    raise Exception(f"An error occurred while training the cropio: {e}")
```

### Key Points to Note

- **Positive Integer Requirement:** Ensure that the number of iterations (`n_iterations`) is a positive integer. The code will raise a `ValueError` if this condition is not met.
- **Filename Requirement:** Ensure that the filename ends with `.pkl`. The code will raise a `ValueError` if this condition is not met.
- **Error Handling:** The code handles subprocess errors and unexpected exceptions, providing error messages to the user.

It is important to note that the training process may take some time, depending on the complexity of your agents and will also require your feedback on each iteration.

Once the training is complete, your agents will be equipped with enhanced capabilities and knowledge, ready to tackle complex tasks and provide more consistent and valuable insights.

Remember to regularly update and retrain your agents to ensure they stay up-to-date with the latest information and advancements in the field.

Happy training with CropioAI! ðŸš€
