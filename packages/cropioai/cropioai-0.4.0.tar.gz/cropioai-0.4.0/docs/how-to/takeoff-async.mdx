## Introduction

CropioAI provides the ability to takeoff a cropio asynchronously, allowing you to start the cropio execution in a non-blocking manner. 
This feature is particularly useful when you want to run multiple cropios concurrently or when you need to perform other tasks while the cropio is executing.

## Asynchronous Cropio Execution

To takeoff a cropio asynchronously, use the `takeoff_async()` method. This method initiates the cropio execution in a separate thread, allowing the main thread to continue executing other tasks.

### Method Signature

```python Code
def takeoff_async(self, inputs: dict) -> CropioOutput:
```

### Parameters

- `inputs` (dict): A dictionary containing the input data required for the tasks.

### Returns

- `CropioOutput`: An object representing the result of the cropio execution.

## Potential Use Cases

- **Parallel Content Generation**: Takeoff multiple independent cropios asynchronously, each responsible for generating content on different topics. For example, one cropio might research and draft an article on AI trends, while another cropio generates social media posts about a new product launch. Each cropio operates independently, allowing content production to scale efficiently.

- **Concurrent Market Research Tasks**: Launch multiple cropios asynchronously to conduct market research in parallel. One cropio might analyze industry trends, while another examines competitor strategies, and yet another evaluates consumer sentiment. Each cropio independently completes its task, enabling faster and more comprehensive insights.

- **Independent Travel Planning Modules**: Execute separate cropios to independently plan different aspects of a trip. One cropio might handle flight options, another handles accommodation, and a third plans activities. Each cropio works asynchronously, allowing various components of the trip to be planned simultaneously and independently for faster results.

## Example: Single Asynchronous Cropio Execution

Here's an example of how to takeoff a cropio asynchronously using asyncio and awaiting the result:

```python Code
import asyncio
from cropioai import Cropio, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create a task that requires code execution
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

# Create a cropio and add the task
analysis_cropio = Cropio(
    agents=[coding_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task]
)

# Async function to takeoff the cropio asynchronously
async def async_cropio_execution():
    result = await analysis_cropio.takeoff_async(inputs={"ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]})
    print("Cropio Result:", result)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(async_cropio_execution())
```

## Example: Multiple Asynchronous Cropio Executions

In this example, we'll show how to takeoff multiple cropios asynchronously and wait for all of them to complete using `asyncio.gather()`:

```python Code
import asyncio
from cropioai import Cropio, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create tasks that require code execution
task_1 = Task(
    description="Analyze the first dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

task_2 = Task(
    description="Analyze the second dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

# Create two cropios and add tasks
cropio_1 = Cropio(agents=[coding_agent], tasks=[task_1])
cropio_2 = Cropio(agents=[coding_agent], tasks=[task_2])

# Async function to takeoff multiple cropios asynchronously and wait for all to finish
async def async_multiple_cropios():
    result_1 = cropio_1.takeoff_async(inputs={"ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]})
    result_2 = cropio_2.takeoff_async(inputs={"ages": [20, 22, 24, 28, 30]})

    # Wait for both cropios to finish
    results = await asyncio.gather(result_1, result_2)

    for i, result in enumerate(results, 1):
        print(f"Cropio {i} Result:", result)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(async_multiple_cropios())
```
