## Introduction

CropioAI provides the ability to replay from a task specified from the latest cropio takeoff. This feature is particularly useful when you've finished a takeoff and may want to retry certain tasks or don't need to refetch data over and your agents already have the context saved from the takeoff execution so you just need to replay the tasks you want to.

<Note>
    You must run `cropio.takeoff()` before you can replay a task. 
    Currently, only the latest takeoff is supported, so if you use `takeoff_for_each`, it will only allow you to replay from the most recent cropio run.
</Note>

Here's an example of how to replay from a task:

### Replaying from Specific Task Using the CLI

To use the replay feature, follow these steps:

<Steps>
   <Step title="Open your terminal or command prompt.">
   </Step>
   <Step title="Navigate to the directory where your CropioAI project is located.">
   </Step>
   <Step title="Run the following commands:">
      To view the latest takeoff task_ids use:

      ```shell
      cropioai log-tasks-outputs
      ```

      Once you have your `task_id` to replay, use:

      ```shell
      cropioai replay -t <task_id>
      ```
   </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
    Ensure `cropioai` is installed and configured correctly in your development environment.
</Note>

### Replaying from a Task Programmatically

To replay from a task programmatically, use the following steps:

<Steps>
   <Step title="Specify the `task_id` and input parameters for the replay process.">
      Specify the `task_id` and input parameters for the replay process.
   </Step>
   <Step title="Execute the replay command within a try-except block to handle potential errors.">
      Execute the replay command within a try-except block to handle potential errors.
      <CodeGroup>
          ```python Code
            def replay():
            """
            Replay the cropio execution from a specific task.
            """
            task_id = '<task_id>'
            inputs = {"topic": "CropioAI Training"}  # This is optional; you can pass in the inputs you want to replay; otherwise, it uses the previous takeoff's inputs.
            try:
                YourCropioName_Cropio().cropio().replay(task_id=task_id, inputs=inputs)

            except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
                raise Exception(f"An error occurred while replaying the cropio: {e}")

            except Exception as e:
                raise Exception(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
            ```
      </CodeGroup>
   </Step>
</Steps>

## Conclusion

With the above enhancements and detailed functionality, replaying specific tasks in CropioAI has been made more efficient and robust. 
Ensure you follow the commands and steps precisely to make the most of these features.
