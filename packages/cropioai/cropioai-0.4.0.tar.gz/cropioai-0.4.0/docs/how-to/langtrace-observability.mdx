# Langtrace Overview

Langtrace is an open-source, external tool that helps you set up observability and evaluations for Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM frameworks, and Vector Databases. 
While not built directly into CropioAI, Langtrace can be used alongside CropioAI to gain deep visibility into the cost, latency, and performance of your CropioAI Agents. 
This integration allows you to log hyperparameters, monitor performance regressions, and establish a process for continuous improvement of your Agents.

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>
   <Step title="Sign up for Langtrace">
      Sign up by visiting [https://langtrace.ai/signup](https://langtrace.ai/signup).
   </Step>
   <Step title="Create a project">
      Set the project type to `CropioAI` and generate an API key.
   </Step>
   <Step title="Install Langtrace in your CropioAI project">
      Use the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install langtrace-python-sdk
    ```
   </Step>
   <Step title="Import Langtrace">
      Import and initialize Langtrace at the beginning of your script, before any CropioAI imports:

    ```python
    from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
    langtrace.init(api_key='<LANGTRACE_API_KEY>')

    # Now import CropioAI modules
    from cropioai import Agent, Task, Cropio
    ```
   </Step>
</Steps> 

### Features and Their Application to CropioAI

1. **LLM Token and Cost Tracking**

   - Monitor the token usage and associated costs for each CropioAI agent interaction.

2. **Trace Graph for Execution Steps**

   - Visualize the execution flow of your CropioAI tasks, including latency and logs.
   - Useful for identifying bottlenecks in your agent workflows.

3. **Dataset Curation with Manual Annotation**

   - Create datasets from your CropioAI task outputs for future training or evaluation.

4. **Prompt Versioning and Management**

   - Keep track of different versions of prompts used in your CropioAI agents.
   - Useful for A/B testing and optimizing agent performance.

5. **Prompt Playground with Model Comparisons**

   - Test and compare different prompts and models for your CropioAI agents before deployment.

6. **Testing and Evaluations**

   - Set up automated tests for your CropioAI agents and tasks.
