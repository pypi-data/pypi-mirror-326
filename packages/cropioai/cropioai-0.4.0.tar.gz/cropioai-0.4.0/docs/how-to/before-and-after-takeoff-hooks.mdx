title: Before and After Takeoff Hooks
description: Learn how to use before and after takeoff hooks in CropioAI
---

CropioAI provides hooks that allow you to execute code before and after a cropio's takeoff. These hooks are useful for preprocessing inputs or post-processing results.

## Before Takeoff Hook

The before takeoff hook is executed before the cropio starts its tasks. It receives the input dictionary and can modify it before passing it to the cropio. You can use this hook to set up your environment, load necessary data, or preprocess your inputs. This is useful in scenarios where the input data might need enrichment or validation before being processed by the cropio.

Here's an example of defining a before takeoff function in your `cropio.py`:

```python
from cropioai import CropioBase, before_takeoff

@CropioBase
class MyCropio:
    @before_takeoff
    def prepare_data(self, inputs):
        # Preprocess or modify inputs
        inputs['processed'] = True
        return inputs

#...
```

In this example, the prepare_data function modifies the inputs by adding a new key-value pair indicating that the inputs have been processed.

## After Takeoff Hook

The after takeoff hook is executed after the cropio has completed its tasks. It receives the result object, which contains the outputs of the cropio's execution. This hook is ideal for post-processing results, such as logging, data transformation, or further analysis.

Here's how you can define an after takeoff function in your `cropio.py`:

```python
from cropioai import CropioBase, after_takeoff

@CropioBase
class MyCropio:
    @after_takeoff
    def log_results(self, result):
        # Log or modify the results
        print("Cropio execution completed with result:", result)
        return result

# ...
```


In the `log_results` function, the results of the cropio execution are simply printed out. You can extend this to perform more complex operations such as sending notifications or integrating with other services.

## Utilizing Both Hooks

Both hooks can be used together to provide a comprehensive setup and teardown process for your cropio's execution. They are particularly useful in maintaining clean code architecture by separating concerns and enhancing the modularity of your CropioAI implementations.

## Conclusion

Before and after takeoff hooks in CropioAI offer powerful ways to interact with the lifecycle of a cropio's execution. By understanding and utilizing these hooks, you can greatly enhance the robustness and flexibility of your AI agents.
