## Introduction

CropioAI provides the ability to takeoff a cropio for each item in a list, allowing you to execute the cropio for each item in the list. 
This feature is particularly useful when you need to perform the same set of tasks for multiple items.

## Kicking Off a Cropio for Each Item

To takeoff a cropio for each item in a list, use the `takeoff_for_each()` method. 
This method executes the cropio for each item in the list, allowing you to process multiple items efficiently.

Here's an example of how to takeoff a cropio for each item in a list:

```python Code
from cropioai import Cropio, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create a task that requires code execution
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent,
    expected_output="The average age calculated from the dataset"
)

# Create a cropio and add the task
analysis_cropio = Cropio(
    agents=[coding_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task],
    verbose=True,
    memory=False,
    respect_context_window=True  # enable by default
)

datasets = [
  { "ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45] },
  { "ages": [20, 25, 30, 35, 40] },
  { "ages": [30, 35, 40, 45, 50] }
]

# Execute the cropio
result = analysis_cropio.takeoff_for_each(inputs=datasets)
```
