        the Software with hardware, software or data not agreed by Hygeos where the
        used Software alone in their original, unmodified form would not constitute an
        infringement. The foregoing states the User's entire liability for infringement
        or claims of infringement of patents, copyrights or other intellectual property
        right.

        Hygeos’ and User’s Contact Email. 
        
        ## SECTION 18. SEVERABILITY 
        In the event any provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or
        unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms of Use shall remain in force as if
        such provision were not a part.

## Examples
### Basic exemple
```python
>>> import geoclide as gc
>>> import numpy as np
>>> # Some basics
>>> p1 = gc.Point(0., 0., 0.) # create a point
>>> v1 = gc.normalize(gc.Vector(0.5, 0.5, 0.1)) # create a vector and normalize it
>>> v1
Vector(0.4082482904638631, 0.4082482904638631, 0.8164965809277261)
>>> # With a point and a vector we can create a ray
>>> r1 = gc.Ray(o=p1, d=v1)
>>> r1
r(t) = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) + t*(0.4082482904638631, 0.4082482904638631, 0.8164965809277261) with t ∈ [0,inf[
>>> # Let's create a triangle mesh with 2 triangles
>>> # We have 4 vertices
>>> p0 = gc.Point(-5, -5, 0.)
>>> p1 = gc.Point(5, -5, 0.)
>>> p2 = gc.Point(-5, 5, 0.)
>>> p3 = gc.Point(5, 5, 0.)
>>> v = np.array([p0, p1, p2, p3], dtype=gc.Point)
>>> # Get the vertices indices of each triangle
>>> vid_t0 = np.array([0, 1, 2]) # the vertices indices of triangle 0
>>> vid_t1 = np.array([2, 3, 1]) # the vertices indices of triangle 1
>>> vi = np.concatenate((vid_t0, vid_t1)) # regroup everything
>>> # Here if we create the triangle mesh, it would be a square of dimension 10*10
>>> # centered at origin (0.,0.,0.) and parallel to the xy plane
>>> # We can create a transformation to translate and rotate it
>>> translate = gc.get_translate_tf(gc.Vector(2.5, 0., 0.)) # translation of 2.5 in x axis
>>> rotate = gc.get_rotateY_tf(-90.) # rotation of -90 degrees around the y axis
>>> oTw = translate*rotate # object to world transformation to apply to the triangle mesh
>>> tri_mesh = gc.TriangleMesh(vi, v, oTw=oTw) # create the triangle mesh
>>> ds = gc.calc_intersection(tri_mesh, r1) # see if the ray r1 intersect the triangle mesh

### Example for remote sensing applications
```python
import geoclide as gc
import math

# Find satellite x an y positions knowing its altitude and its viewing zenith and azimuth angles
vza = 45. # viewing zenith angle in degrees
vaa = 45. # viewing azimuth angle in degrees
sat_altitude = 700.  # satellite altitude in kilometers
origin = gc.Point(0., 0., 0.) # origin is the viewer seeing the satellite
# The vaa start from north going clockwise.
# Let's assume that in our coordinate system the x axis is in the north direction
# Then theta (zenith) angle = vza and phi (azimuth) angle = -vaa
theta = vza
phi = -vaa

# Find the direction from ground to the satellite
dir_to_sat = gc.Vector(0., 0., 1.)  # start facing zenith
dir_to_sat = gc.get_rotateY_tf(theta)[dir_to_sat] # perform a rotation around y axis to consider vza
dir_to_sat = gc.get_rotateZ_tf(phi)[dir_to_sat]   # then a rotation around z axis to consider vaa
ray = gc.Ray(o=origin, d=dir_to_sat) # create the ray, starting from origin going in dir_to_sat direction

# Here without considering the sphericity of the earth
b1 = gc.BBox(p1=gc.Point(-math.inf, -math.inf, 0.), p2=gc.Point(math.inf, math.inf, sat_altitude))
ds_pp = gc.calc_intersection(b1, ray) # return an xarray dataset

# Here with the consideration of the sphericity of the earth
earth_radius = 6378. # the equatorial earth radius in kilometers
oTw = gc.get_translate_tf(gc.Vector(0., 0., -earth_radius))
sphere_sat_alti = gc.Sphere(radius=earth_radius+sat_altitude, oTw=oTw)  # apply oTw to move the sphere center to earth center
ds_sp = gc.calc_intersection(sphere_sat_alti, ray) # return an xarray dataset

print ("Satellite position (pp case) :", ds_pp['phit'].values)
print ("Satellite position (sp case) ", ds_sp['phit'].values)
```
