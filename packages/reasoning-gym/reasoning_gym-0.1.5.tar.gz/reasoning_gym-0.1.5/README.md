# Reasoning Gym

We are building a python library of procedural dataset generators and algorithmically verifiable reasoning environments for training Reasoning Models with reinforcement learning (RL).

The goal is to generate virtually infinite data with adjustable complexity.

Algorithmic verification allows to train on tasks like Rubikâ€˜s cube or [Countdown](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)#Numbers_Round>) which have many correct solutions.

## Set up for development

1. Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/open-thought/reasoning-gym.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment (here we use conda)

```
conda create --name reasoning_gym python=3.11 -y
conda activate reasoning_gym
```

3. Link project and install dependencies

```
pip install -e .
```

4. Install development dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

> NOTE: To consume the APIs in reasoning_gym, just install from pip using the following

```
pip install reasoning-gym
```

## How to instantiate a task dataset?

Example:

```python
import reasoning_gym
data = reasoning_gym.create_dataset('leg_counting', size=10, seed=42)
for i, x in enumerate(data):
    print(f'{i}: q="{x['question']}", a="{x['answer']}"')
    print('metadata:', x['metadata'])
    # use the dataset's `score_answer` method for algorithmic verification
    assert data.score_answer(answer=x['answer'], entry=x) == 1.0
```

Output:

```
0: q="How many legs are there in total if you have 1 sea slug, 1 deer?", a="4"
metadata: {'animals': {'sea slug': 1, 'deer': 1}, 'total_legs': 4}
1: q="How many legs are there in total if you have 2 sheeps, 2 dogs?", a="16"
metadata: {'animals': {'sheep': 2, 'dog': 2}, 'total_legs': 16}
2: q="How many legs are there in total if you have 1 crab, 2 lobsters, 1 human, 1 cow, 1 bee?", a="42"
...
```
