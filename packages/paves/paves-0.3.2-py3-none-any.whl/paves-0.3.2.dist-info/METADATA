# PAV√âS: Bajo los adoquines, la PLAYA üèñÔ∏è

The goal with **PLAYA** is just to get objects out of PDF, with no
dependencies or further analysis.  So, over top of **PLAYA** there is
**PAV√âS**: "**P**DF, **A**nalyse et **V**isualisation ... plus
**√â**labor√©e**s**", I guess?

Anything that deviates from the core mission of "getting objects out
of PDF" goes here, so, hopefully, more interesting analysis and
extraction that may be useful for all of you AI Bros doing
"Partitioning" and "Retrieval-Assisted-Generation" and suchlike
things.  But specifically, visualization stuff inspired by the "visual
debugging" features of `pdfplumber` but not specifically tied to its
data structures and algorithms.

There will be dependencies.  Oh, there will be dependencies.

## Installation

```console
pip install paves
```

## Workin' in a PDF mine

`pdfminer.six` is widely used for text extraction and layout analysis
due to its liberal licensing terms.  Unfortunately it is quite slow
and contains many bugs.  Now you can use PAV√âS instead:

```python
from paves.miner import extract, LAParams

laparams = LAParams()
for page in extract(path, laparams):
    # do something
```

This is generally faster than `pdfminer.six`.  You can often make it
even faster on large documents by running in parallel with the
`max_workers` argument, which is the same as the one you will find in
`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`.  If you pass `None` it will
use all your CPUs, but due to some unavoidable overhead, it usually
doesn't help to use more than 2-4:

```
for page in extract(path, laparams, max_workers=2):
    # do something
```

There are a few differences with `pdfminer.six` (some might call them
bug fixes):

- By default, if you do not pass the `laparams` argument to `extract`,
  no layout analysis at all is done.  This is different from
  `extract_pages` in `pdfminer.six` which will set some default
  parameters for you.  If you don't see any `LTTextBox` items in your
  `LTPage` then this is why!
- Rectangles are recognized correctly in some cases where
  `pdfminer.six` thought they were "curves".
- Colours and colour spaces are the PLAYA versions, which do not
  correspond to what `pdfminer.six` gives you, because what
  `pdfminer.six` gives you is not useful and often wrong.
- You have access to the list of enclosing marked content sections in
  every `LTComponent`, as the `mcstack` attribute.
- Bounding boxes of rotated glyphs are the actual bounding box.

Probably more... but you didn't use any of that stuff anyway, you just
wanted to get `LTTextBoxes` to feed to your hallucination factories.

## PLAYA Bears

[PLAYA](https://github.com/dhdaines/playa) has a nice "lazy" API which
is efficient but does take a bit of work to use.  If, on the other
hand, **you** are lazy, then you can use `paves.bears`, which will
flatten everything for you into a friendly dictionary representation
(but it is a
[`TypedDict`](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/typeddict.html#typeddict))
which, um, looks a lot like what `pdfplumber` gives you, except
possibly in a different coordinate space, as defined [in the PLAYA
documentation](https://github.com/dhdaines/playa#an-important-note-about-coordinate-spaces).

```python
from paves.bears import extract

for dic in extract(path):
    print("it is a {dic['object_type']} at ({dic['x0']}", {dic['y0']}))
    print("    the color is {dic['stroking_color']}")
    print("    the text is {dic['text']}")
    print("    it is in MCS {dic['mcid']} which is a {dic['tag']}")
    print("    it is also in Form XObject {dic['xobjid']}")
```

This can be used to do machine learning of various sorts.  For
instance, you can write `page.layout` to a CSV file:

```python
from paves.bears import FIELDNAMES

writer = DictWriter(outfh, fieldnames=FIELDNAMES)
writer.writeheader()
for dic in extract(path):
    writer.writerow(dic)
```

you can also create a Pandas DataFrame:

```python
df = pandas.DataFrame.from_records(extract(path))
```

or a Polars DataFrame or LazyFrame:

```python
from paves.bears import SCHEMA

df = polars.DataFrame(extract(path), schema=SCHEMA)
```

As above, you can use multiple CPUs with `max_workers`, and this will
scale considerably better than `paves.miner`.
