TAUP_DATKit
============

Overview
--------
TAUP_DATKit (*TAU Protein - Data Analysis Tool Kit*) is a package designed for data analysis on chromatographic data. It includes various functions for:

- Loading data from different sources, such as CSV and Excel files.
- Merging data and homogenizing spectra using data interpolation techniques.
- Complex filtering of elements.
- Representation and visualization of distances and similarities between elements.

Project Context
---------------
This package is part of the *TAU Protein*: "Systematic manipulation of tau protein aggregation: bridging biochemical and pathological properties".

Library Structure
