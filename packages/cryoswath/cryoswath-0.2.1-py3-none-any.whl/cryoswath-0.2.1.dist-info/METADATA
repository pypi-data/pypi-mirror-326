cryoswath is a python package containing processing pipelines, a tool
library, and some pre-assembled data to retrieve and study CryoSat-2
data.

Adaptability lies at its core. The user can access many options simply
by passing arguments to functions; everything else can be customized
changing the concerned function or adding a new one.

## 🌱 state

cryoswath is being developed. `main` contains those parts that I
believe to work if used as intended and that are tested to some
extent. Other branches are for development.

## ✨ features

- find all CryoSat-2 tracks passing over your region of interest
- download L1b data from ESA
- retrieve swath elevation estimates
- aggregate point data to gridded data
- fill data gaps using tested methods
- calculate change rates

## 🚀 getting started

There is a number of ways you can start off. I will give detailed
instructions for UNIX systems. Make sure to use python 3.11 or higher.
Further, I recommend to use a virtual environment and will involve
python-venv in the instructions (however, conda works similar).

### with git 🐙

advantage: easy pulling bugfixes

Set up a project directory, pull this repo, create virtual
environment, initialize, and download ArcticDEM and the RGI glacier and complex
shape files into the `data/auxiliary/DEM` and -`RGI` directories.

```sh
proj_dir=altimetry-project
git clone https://github.com/j-haacker/cryoswath.git $proj_dir
cd $proj_dir
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
cryoswath-init
```

### with pip 📦

advantage: easy installation

Set up a project directory, create virtual environment, install
cryoswath, initialize, and download ArcticDEM and the RGI glacier and
complex shape files into the `data/auxiliary/DEM` and -`RGI`
directories.

```sh
proj_dir=altimetry-project
cd $proj_dir
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install cryoswath
cryoswath-init
```

### Docker and conda

New setup instructions coming soon.

### multiple projects

Similar to the above, set up a virtual environment but rather locate it
in a neutral directory. For each project, run `cryoswath-init`.

## 📖 documentation

[j-haacker.github.io/cryoswath](https://j-haacker.github.io/cryoswath/)

## dependencies

- [requirements.txt](https://github.com/j-haacker/cryoswath/blob/main/requirements.txt)
- reference elevation model
- glacier outlines

cryoswath will point you to the required resources.

## 🐛 known issues

- projected RGI basins sometimes "invalid"
    -> add `.make_valid()` if it is missing somewhere
- it has mostly been tested for the Arctic

  Further: see [open issues](https://github.com/j-haacker/cryoswath/issues).
