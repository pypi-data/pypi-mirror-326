    The search looks across multiple fields:

    Features:
    - Case-insensitive matching
    - Partial word matches
    - Returns full entity objects with relations
    - Includes all matching entities
    - If a category is specified, only entities with that category are returned

    Example Queries:
    - "memory" - Find entities related to memory systems
    - "SQLite" - Find database-related components
    - "test" - Find test-related entities
    - "implementation" - Find concrete implementations
    - "service" - Find service components

    Note: Currently uses SQL ILIKE for matching. Wildcard (*) searches
    and full-text search capabilities are planned for future versions.
