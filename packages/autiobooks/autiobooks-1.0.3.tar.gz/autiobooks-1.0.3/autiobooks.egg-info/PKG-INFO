# Autiobooks: Automatically convert epubs to audiobooks
[![Installing via pip and running](https://github.com/plusuncold/autiobooks/actions/workflows/pip-install.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/plusuncold/autiobooks/actions/workflows/pip-install.yaml)

Autiobooks generates `.m4b` audiobooks from regular `.epub` e-books, using Kokoro's high-quality speech synthesis.

[Kokoro](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) is an open-weight text-to-speech model with 82 million parameters. It yields natural sounding output while being able to run on consumer hardware.

It supports American, British English, French, Korean, Japanese and Mandarin (though we only-support English, for now) and a wide range of different voices with different accents and prosody.

PRs are welcome!

## How to install and run

(Note that pip installs are currently not working - we are looking
into the cause of this, but in the meantime, please download the 
repo and run directly)

If you have Python 3 on your computer, you can install it with pip.
Be aware that it won't work with Python 3.13.

```bash
pip install autiobooks
```

You will require `ffmpeg` and `tkinter` installed:

Linux:
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg python3-tkinter
```
MacOS:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg python-tk
```

To start the program, run:

```bash
autiobooks
```

The program creates .wav files for each chapter, then combines them into a .m4b file for playing using an audiobook player.

## Roadmap

In no particular order:

- Windows support
- GPU support (currently untested)
- CI tests - including handling of corner cases and odd epubs
- PDF Support
