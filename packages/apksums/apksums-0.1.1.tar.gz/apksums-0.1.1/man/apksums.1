APKSUMS(1)                          User Commands                         APKSUMS(1)

NAME
       apksums - verify checksums of installed APK package files

SYNOPSIS
       apksums [-h] [-c] [-s] [-m file] [-r dir]

DESCRIPTION
       apksums verifies the integrity of files installed by the Alpine Package
       Keeper (APK) by comparing their current checksums against the stored values
       in the package database.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show help message and exit.

       -c, --changed
              Report only changed files to stdout. This option implies --silent.

       -s, --silent
              Only report errors. Suppresses OK messages and summary.

       -m file, --md5sums=file
              Read list of checksums from specified file instead of the default
              /lib/apk/db/installed.

       -r dir, --root=dir
              Use specified directory as root for checking files instead of /.

EXIT STATUS
       0      All files verified successfully
       1      Verification failed (missing or modified files)

OUTPUT
       Without -s or -c options, apksums prints status for each file:
           OK: /path/to/file (from package-name)
           FAILED: /path/to/file (from package-name)
           MISSING: /path/to/file (from package-name)

       For failed files, it shows:
           Expected: <expected-checksum>
           Got: <actual-checksum>

       For symbolic links, it shows the link target:
           OK: /path/to/link -> target (from package-name)

       A summary is printed at the end showing counts of OK, Failed, and Missing
       files.

EXAMPLES
       apksums
              Verify all installed files with default settings

       apksums -s
              Verify files but only show errors

       apksums -c
              Show only list of changed files

       apksums -r /mnt/rootfs
              Verify files in alternative root directory

       apksums -m /path/to/checksums
              Use alternative checksums database file
