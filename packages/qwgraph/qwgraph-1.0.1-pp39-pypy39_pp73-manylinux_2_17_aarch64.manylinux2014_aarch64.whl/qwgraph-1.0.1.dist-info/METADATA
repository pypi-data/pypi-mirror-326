# About

This is the source for the python package `qwgraph`. 
This package's aim is to provide an efficient implementation of quantum walks on graphs. 

The quantum walk model implemented in this package follows the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10451 . This model is specifically designed for searching.

Most of the critical functions of this package are implemented and compiled in rust, providing an efficient simulation.

An example notebook can be found at https://github.com/mroget/qwgraph/blob/main/demo.ipynb

# Installation
