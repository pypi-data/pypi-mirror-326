    pushing the mapped axis down into primitive operations.

    Parallel map with support for collective operations.

    The purpose of :py:func:`pmap` is to express single-program multiple-data
    (SPMD) programs. Applying :py:func:`pmap` to a function will compile the
    function with XLA (similarly to :py:func:`jit`), then execute it in parallel
    on XLA devices, such as multiple GPUs or multiple TPU cores. Semantically it
    is comparable to :py:func:`vmap` because both transformations map a function
    over array axes, but where :py:func:`vmap` vectorizes functions by pushing the
    mapped axis down into primitive operations, :py:func:`pmap` instead replicates
    the function and executes each replica on its own XLA device in parallel.

    The mapped axis size must be less than or equal to the number of local XLA
    devices available, as returned by :py:func:`jax.local_device_count()` (unless
    ``devices`` is specified, see below). For nested :py:func:`pmap` calls, the
    product of the mapped axis sizes must be less than or equal to the number of
    XLA devices.

    More information please see `jax.vmap <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html>`__.


    Args:
      fn: Function to be mapped over argument axes. Its arguments and return
        value should be arrays, scalars, or (nested) standard Python containers
        (tuple/list/dict) thereof. Positional arguments indicated by
        ``static_broadcasted_argnums`` can be anything at all, provided they are
        hashable and have an equality operation defined.
      axis_name: Optional, a hashable Python object used to identify the mapped
        axis so that parallel collectives can be applied.
      in_axes: A non-negative integer, None, or nested Python container thereof
        that specifies which axes of positional arguments to map over. Arguments
        passed as keywords are always mapped over their leading axis (i.e. axis
        index 0). See :py:func:`vmap` for details.
      out_axes: A non-negative integer, None, or nested Python container thereof
        indicating where the mapped axis should appear in the output. All outputs
        with a mapped axis must have a non-None ``out_axes`` specification
        (see :py:func:`vmap`).
      static_broadcasted_argnums: An int or collection of ints specifying which
        positional arguments to treat as static (compile-time constant).
        Operations that only depend on static arguments will be constant-folded.
        Calling the pmapped function with different values for these constants
        will trigger recompilation. If the pmapped function is called with fewer
        positional arguments than indicated by ``static_broadcasted_argnums`` then
        an error is raised. Each of the static arguments will be broadcasted to
        all devices. Arguments that are not arrays or containers thereof must be
        marked as static. Defaults to ().

        Static arguments must be hashable, meaning both ``__hash__`` and
        ``__eq__`` are implemented, and should be immutable.

      devices: This is an experimental feature and the API is likely to change.
        Optional, a sequence of Devices to map over. (Available devices can be
        retrieved via jax.devices()). Must be given identically for each process
        in multi-process settings (and will therefore include devices across
        processes). If specified, the size of the mapped axis must be equal to
        the number of devices in the sequence local to the given process. Nested
        :py:func:`pmap` s with ``devices`` specified in either the inner or outer
        :py:func:`pmap` are not yet supported.
      backend: This is an experimental feature and the API is likely to change.
        Optional, a string representing the XLA backend. 'cpu', 'gpu', or 'tpu'.
      axis_size: Optional; the size of the mapped axis.
      donate_argnums: Specify which positional argument buffers are "donated" to
        the computation. It is safe to donate argument buffers if you no longer need
        them once the computation has finished. In some cases XLA can make use of
        donated buffers to reduce the amount of memory needed to perform a
        computation, for example recycling one of your input buffers to store a
        result. You should not reuse buffers that you donate to a computation, JAX
        will raise an error if you try to.
        Note that donate_argnums only work for positional arguments, and keyword
        arguments will not be donated.

        For more details on buffer donation see the
        `FAQ <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#buffer-donation>`_.
      global_arg_shapes: Optional; a tuple of tuples of integers representing the
        shapes of the global arguments. These are arguments that are not replicated
        across devices, but are broadcasted to all devices. The tuple should have
        the same length as the number of global arguments, and each inner tuple
        should have the same length as the corresponding argument. The shapes of
        the global arguments must be the same on all devices.
      rngs: Optional, a random number generator or sequence of random number
        generators to be used in the mapped function. These random number
        generators are restored their random key after the mapped function is
        executed.

    Returns:
      A parallelized version of ``fun`` with arguments that correspond to those of
      ``fun`` but with extra array axes at positions indicated by ``in_axes`` and
      with output that has an additional leading array axis (with the same size).

    """
    Map a function over leading array axes.

    Like Python's builtin map, except inputs and outputs are in the form of
    stacked arrays. Consider using the :func:`~jax.vmap` transform instead, unless you
    need to apply a function element by element for reduced memory usage or
    heterogeneous computation with other control flow primitives.

    When ``xs`` is an array type, the semantics of :func:`~map` are given by this
    Python implementation::

        def map(f, *xs):
            return np.stack([f(*x) for x in xs])

    Like :func:`~scan`, :func:`~map` is implemented in terms of JAX primitives so
    many of the same advantages over a Python loop apply: ``xs`` may be an
    arbitrary nested pytree type, and the mapped computation is compiled only
    once.

    If ``batch_size`` is provided, the computation is executed in batches of that size
    and parallelized using :func:`~jax.vmap`. This can be used as either a more performant
    version of ``map`` or as a memory-efficient version of ``vmap``. If the axis is not
    divisible by the batch size, the remainder is processed in a separate ``vmap`` and
    concatenated to the result.

    In the example above, "inner shape" is printed twice, once while tracing the batched
    computation and once while tracing the remainder computation.

    Args:
        f: a Python function to apply element-wise over the first axis or axes of
            ``xs``.
        xs: values over which to map along the leading axis.
        batch_size: (optional) integer specifying the size of the batch for each step to execute
            in parallel.

    Returns:
        Mapped values.
