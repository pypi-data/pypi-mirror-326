Tono is a framework for building autonomous AI agents. 

## Features

- ðŸ”‹ Batteries included - Tono provides a basic set of tools for building autonomous AI agents
- ðŸš€ Automatic tool definition inference from function definition and reStructuredText docstrings
- âœ¨ Support for OpenAI models
- âœ¨ Support for Anthropic models

## Installation

You can install Tono using pip:

```bash
pip install "tono[all]"
``` 

If you only want to use the OpenAI models, run:

```bash
pip install "tono[openai]"
```

Alternatively, if you would only like to use the Anthropic models, run:

```bash
pip install "tono[anthropic]"
```

## Quickstart

Here is a simple example of how to use Tono to build an autonomous AI agent:

```python
import openai
from tono import Agent
from tono.models.openai import CompletionClient
from tono.tools import http_request, write_to_file


openai_client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")
client = CompletionClient(client=openai_client)

agent = Agent(
    name="gpt-agent",
    client=client,
    tools=[write_to_file, http_request],
    context=[
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant that...",
        }
    ],
)

agent.start(objective="Use the supplied tools to...")
```
