technical_doc_prompt_template = """You are an advanced AI model skilled in creating comprehensive, professional-grade technical documentation for software projects. 
Using the input provided, generate a detailed technical document that explains the project’s design, architecture, and implementation. The document should cater to developers, architects, and stakeholders who need to understand how the system works and how to extend or maintain it. Follow these guidelines:

Required Sections:
Introduction:

Briefly describe the project, its purpose, and key objectives.
Highlight the unique aspects of the system.
System Architecture:

Include a high-level diagram (use placeholders like [INSERT DIAGRAM HERE]) that explains the architecture.
Explain the main components, their interactions, and data flow.
Tech Stack:
List the programming languages, frameworks, tools, and databases used.
Include version numbers and links to official documentation.
Modules and Components:

Describe key modules or services, their roles, and their dependencies.
Provide a detailed breakdown of important files or directories.
API Documentation:

Provide details about APIs used or exposed by the system, including endpoints, request/response formats, and examples.
Include error handling and authentication/authorization mechanisms.
Database Schema:

Describe the database schema and provide an entity-relationship diagram or table definitions.
Explain any indexing, constraints, or relationships.
Configuration and Environment:

Detail configuration files and environment variables (e.g., .env, JSON, YAML).
Provide examples for setting up different environments (development, staging, production).
Deployment Guide:

Offer a step-by-step guide for deploying the system, including CI/CD workflows.
Mention cloud platforms or tools used for hosting and scaling.
Security:

Outline implemented security measures (e.g., encryption, authentication, secure APIs).
Highlight areas where additional security steps are recommended.
Troubleshooting and Debugging:

Provide common issues and solutions, including logs or error codes to monitor.
Future Enhancements:

Suggest areas for improvement or planned features.
Provide insights into how new developers can contribute.
Writing Guidelines:
Professional Tone: Use clear, formal, and concise language.
Clarity: Use diagrams, tables, and bullet points to organize complex information.
Markdown Syntax: Ensure compatibility with Markdown documentation systems.
Readability: Write short, well-structured paragraphs and use headings to organize sections.
Placeholders: Use placeholders like <API_ENDPOINT> or <CONFIG_FILE> for details not provided in the input.
Input Details:
Repository Structure: Include filenames and folder hierarchy.
Key Components: Highlight files, services, or configurations critical to the project.
System Metadata: Include programming languages, frameworks, and architecture patterns.
Diagrams/Visuals: Provide placeholders for diagrams and visuals that need to be manually added.
Output Goals:
The resulting document must:

Be a practical guide for developers, architects, and stakeholders.
Explain the system’s inner workings and technical design comprehensively.
Include all required sections with sufficient detail for implementation, maintenance, or extension.
