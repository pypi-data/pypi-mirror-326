This is an initial library of BibTex references for the structure_step plug-in for SEAMM,
generated automatically by the cookiecutter. You may wish to edit the first entry to correct some
of the information.

Add other references to the end of the file and add code in the plug-in to cite the references as
appropriate. This is done with code like this:

        self.references.cite(
            raw=self._bibliography['doi:10.1002/jcc.21224'],
            alias='packmol',
            module='packmol_step',
            level=1,
            note='The principle PACKMOL citation.'
        )

which is typically in the run() method of the plug-in.

The base node class in SEAMM automatically reads this list of references into a dictionary in
self._bibliography with the key being the key of the BibTex entry -- usually the name on the
first line of the entry after the 'article' or 'misc' (for software) keyword.

See the documentation for the Reference Handler for the other arguments to cite().

# This is the citation for this plug-in, generated and used automatically.
# You might need to edit the author, address, etc. The month, year and version fields
# are automatically filled in with information about current version of the plug-in.
# This is handled in seamm/nody.py, the run() method.

  abstract={
     The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the
     Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and
     analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in
     Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array
     library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For
     example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a
     simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces,
     stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many
     external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform
     interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules
     for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure
     optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and
     performing nudged elastic band calculations.
