A suite of parsers designed to make interacting with
``SERPENT`` [1]_ output files simple and flawless.

The ``SERPENT`` Monte Carlo code
is developed by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Ltd.
More information, including distribution and licensing of ``SERPENT`` can be
found at `<http://montecarlo.vtt.fi>`_

Installation
============

``serpentTools`` can be installed with ``pip`` using::

   $ pip install serpentTools

For more detailed instructions, including operating-system specific
instructions and building from source, see
`Installation Guide <http://serpent-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_.

Alternatively, use ``conda`` with::

  $ conda install -c conda-forge serpentTools

Issues
======

If you have issues installing the project, find a bug, or want to add a feature,
the `GitHub issue page <https://github.com/CORE-GATECH-GROUP/serpent-tools/issues>`_
is the best place to do that.
