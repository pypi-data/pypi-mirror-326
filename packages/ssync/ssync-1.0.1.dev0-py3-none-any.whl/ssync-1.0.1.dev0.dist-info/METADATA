**SocialSync** is a powerful Python library designed to automate interactions with social media platforms while providing advanced tools for code analysis, optimization, and integration with backend systems. Whether you're a developer looking to streamline your workflow or a business aiming to synchronize data across platforms, SocialSync has you covered.

## Key Features

- **Code Analysis and Optimization**: Analyze your Python code for unused variables, inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities. Get actionable suggestions to improve your code quality.
- **Social Media Automation**: Post content, fetch trends, and analyze user engagement across platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.
- **Backend Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with databases, APIs, and caching systems to build robust applications.
- **Machine Learning for Trends**: Use built-in machine learning models to predict future trends and optimize your content strategy.
- **Advanced Logging**: Monitor all operations with detailed logging for debugging and performance tracking.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Perform tasks like posting content or fetching trends asynchronously for maximum efficiency.

## Installation

Install SocialSync via `pip`:

```bash
pip install ssync
```

* For full functionality, including machine learning capabilities, install the optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install 'socialsync[ml]'
```

## Quick Start

### Posting Content to Social Media

```python
from socialsync.api import SocialSyncAPI
from socialsync.auth import AuthHandler

auth = AuthHandler(platform="tiktok", client_id="your_client_id", client_secret="your_client_secret")
auth.get_access_token(code="your_authorization_code")

api = SocialSyncAPI(platform="tiktok", auth_handler=auth)
response = api.post_content("Hello, SocialSync!")
print(response)
```

### Predicting Trends with Machine Learning

```python
from socialsync.analytics import TrendAnalyzer

historical_data = [
    {"day": 1, "popularity": 100},
    {"day": 2, "popularity": 120},
    {"day": 3, "popularity": 150},
]

analyzer = TrendAnalyzer(data_source=None)
model = analyzer.train_trend_forecast_model(historical_data)

future_days = [4, 5, 6]
predictions = analyzer.predict_future_trends(model, future_days)
print("Predicted trends:", predictions)
```

## Configuration

SocialSync supports configuration via `mypy.ini`, `setup.cfg`, or `pyproject.toml`.

### mypy.ini
```ini
[mypy]
plugins =
    socialsync.mypy_plugin

[socialsync]
platforms = tiktok,instagram,twitter
```

### pyproject.toml
```toml
[tool.socialsync]
platforms = ["tiktok", "instagram", "twitter"]

[tool.mypy]
plugins = ["socialsync.mypy_plugin"]
```

## Version Compatibility

| SocialSync | Python Version | Supported Platforms |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 1.0.0        | 3.8+           | TikTok, Instagram, Twitter |

## FAQ

### Can I use SocialSync in production?
